RV analysis example including a Gaussian process activity model
===============================================================

This repository contains an `ipython notebook <https://github.com/r-cloutier/RV_GP_example/blob/master/GP_RVanalysis_example.ipynb>`_ that demonstrates the steps that I take in a typical analysis of an RV time series of a planetary system that contains at least one planet and stellar activity. The example is based on the analysis of the `K2-18 multi-planetary system <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04292>`_. 

Basic Usage
-----------

All of the required data and code-specific python functions are included in this repository. As such, one just needs to clone this repository via::

	git clone https://github.com/r-cloutier/RV_GP_example.git

and open the ipython notebook containing the sample anaysis via::

	jupyter notebook GP_RVanalysis_example.ipynb

Alternatively, if the user does not have `jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ installed, use::

	ipython notebook GP_RVanalysis_example.ipynb
